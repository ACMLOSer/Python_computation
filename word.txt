ines are plotted going through it, all
at different angles. These are shown
in Figure (5) as solid lines.
2. For each solid line a line is plotted
which is perpendicular to it and
which intersects the origin. These are
shown as dashed lines.
3. The length and angle of each
dashed line is measured. In the figure
above, the results are shown in
tables.
4. This is repeated for each data
point
5. A graph of length against angle is
then created.
The point where the lines intersect
gives a distance and angle. This
distance and angle
Radon transform was implemented
according to the following steps:
1. The user must input the threshold
value used for detecting lines.
2. The user must input the input
image which must be black and white
or gray mode. If the input image is a
RGB then it must be converted to
gray level image.
3. Then the edges in the image will
be detected and the result from this
step is a binary file.
4. The next step is to compute the
accumulator matrix using Radon
transform (this matrix is similar to
the tables shown in Figure (5)). The
accumulator matrix is a two
dimensional matrix and from this
matrix the parameters r and q for the
